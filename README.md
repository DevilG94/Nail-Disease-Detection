Nail Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Nail disease can affect the health, strength, and appearance of fingernails and toenails.

List of common nail diseases: -
1.	Nail psoriasis
2.	Brittle splitting nails
3.	Onychogryphosis
4.	Ingrown toenails
5.	Nail fungal infections
6.	Onycholysis
7.	Paronychia

I am sharing another latest project on Nail Disease Detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

About Dataset:
This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of images aimed at supporting the development of machine learning models for detecting nail diseases, including Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, Healthy Nail, Onychogryphosis, Blue Finger, Clubbing, and Pitting diseases.

â€¢	Contains subfolders for each category:
1.	acral_lentiginous_melanoma
2.	healthy_nail
3.	onychogryphosis
4.	blue_finger
5.	clubbing
6.	pitting
7.	
Each subfolder contains images related to the specific nail condition.
